# Fun-With-Projects
Here is a record of my progress on HackerRank. So many funny projects!

## Sock Merchant
John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair by color for sale. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

For example, there are n = 7 socks with colors ar = [1,2,1,2,1,3,2]. There is one pair of color 1 and one of color 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.

## Counting Valleys
Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly n steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.

For example, if Gary's path is s = [DDUUUUDD] , he first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.

## Jumping on the Clouds
Emma is playing a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. She can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of the current cloud plus 1 or 2. She must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take Emma to jump from her starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game.

For each game, Emma will get an array of clouds numbered 0 if they are safe or 1 if they must be avoided. For example, c = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0] indexed from 0...6. The number on each cloud is its index in the list so she must avoid the clouds at indexes 1 and 5. She could follow the following two paths: 0->2->4->6 or 0->2->3->4->6. The first path takes 3 jumps while the second takes 4.

## Repeated String
Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.

Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.

For example, if the string s = 'abcac' and n = 10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.

## Hash Tables: Ransom Note
Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will be traced back to him through his handwriting. He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.

For example, the note is "Attack at dawn". The magazine contains only "attack at dawn". The magazine has all the right words, but there's a case mismatch. The answer is No.

## Two Strings
Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

For example, the words "a", "and", "art" share the common substring a. The words "be" and "cat" do not share a substring.

## Sherlock and Anagrams**
Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.

For example s = mom, the list of all anagrammatic pairs is [m,m],[mo,om] at positions [[0],[2]],[[0,1],[1,2]] respectively.

## 2D Array
Given a 6*6 2D Array, arr:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
We define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in arr's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g
There are 16 hourglasses in arr, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

For example, given the 2D array:

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0
We calculate the following 16 hourglass values:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10, 0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
9, 17, 25, 18
Our highest hourglass value is 18 from the hourglass:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6
